This is a follow-up project to the calorieCounter project. 

Its purpose is to find out how much of the concepts I learnt in the previous
project I retained. 

In the project, I intend to build a concert booking form for a quartet( That I coincidentally happen to know ( and which I am the leader of, Lol). I intend for the form to have the following features : 


1. Make use of a select element to choose the type of concert
2. After selecting this, have some dynamic content rendered to the form
3. Have the user tick some optional features and use them in calculation of final payable amount
4. Have the user fill in their name, email and phone number.
5. Display the an invoice-like breakdown of the total cost for the booking as a pop up when the user submits the form.
